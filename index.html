                            <h4>I am a front end web devloper based in Surrey, near London</h4>
                                
                            <p> I studied in Vietnam and completed my Bachelor's Degree in Maths Pedagogy in 2010 and I have worked for secondary schools as a Maths teacher for several years before coming to the UK, i now feel that it is time to realise my dream of working in the IT industry.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p> I have always been interested in computers and technology, ever since my father encouraged me to learn how to use computers when i was 8. Computers have been a part of my life since then. I learned Visual Basic when i was 16 as it was one of the compulsory subjects at school and i totally enjoyed using my Maths and Art skills to create good looking, useful programmes.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>Currently i am studying on a self-funded course in front end web development with a training and recruitment company called Just IT. This opens my understanding to the next level and goes towards making my passion a reality.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>I am a highly effective and committed individual with strong Maths skills, combining good organizational skills and computer language. I have knowledge of Adobe Photoshop, Corel Draw, a natural flair for creativity and a keen eye for detail, now seeking a role as a front-end developer.</p>
